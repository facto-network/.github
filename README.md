# Facto

A truly decentralized Bitcoin blockchain explorer powered by a network of independent node runners.

## What Makes Facto Different?

Most blockchain explorers today are centralized services that create single points of failure for Bitcoin data access. Facto reimagines this model by creating a decentralized network of verifiers who validate and serve blockchain data—all incentivized through Bitcoin's own native unit of account.

### Key Features

- **Micro-payment Architecture**: Each data request costs as little as 1 satoshi
- **Decentralized Verification**: Data is provided and verified by multiple independent nodes
- **Fair Revenue Distribution**: 90% of fees go directly to node runners
- **Lightning-fast Payments**: Built on Lightning Network for instant micro-transactions
- **Self-sustaining Ecosystem**: Node runners earn Bitcoin for honest participation

## How It Works

1. **Request**: Users query the Facto API for blockchain data (account balances, transaction history, etc.)
2. **Verification**: Multiple node runners independently verify and submit the requested data
3. **Consensus**: Results are compared for accuracy across the network
4. **Payment**: Node runners earn satoshis for their honest participation
5. **Delivery**: Verified data is returned to the user

## For Node Runners

Running a Facto node allows you to earn Bitcoin while contributing to a more resilient blockchain data ecosystem:

- Minimal hardware requirements (details in our documentation)
- Automated payment settlements via Lightning Network
- Fair earning potential based on your node's reliability and participation

## For Developers

Integrate with the Facto API to access decentralized Bitcoin blockchain data in your applications.

Full API documentation will be available soon.

## Current Status

Facto is currently in development. Testnet beta coming soon.
